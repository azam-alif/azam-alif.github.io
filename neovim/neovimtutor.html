	    <p>Vim is awesome. It has so many features to talk about. But, Sometime we need something more to automate our works, to fast forward our projects. That's where Neovim comes in. </p>
	    <p>Neovim is like an upgrade version of Vim. It possess all the features of Vim but exceeds in some cases like user experience of using this as an IDE, use some plugins etc, which makes it unique. </p>
	    <p>To install Neovim in your system follow: </p>
	    <ul>
		    <li><b>In Arch: </b>sudo pacman -S neovim</li>
		    <li><b>In Ubuntu: </b>sudo apt install neovim</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>After installing you can use this as Vim, but instead of typing "vim" in terminal, you need to type "nvim". And basic using of neovim is just like vim as I told earlier. </p>
	    <p>There is a neovim Tutor just like vim tutor where you can learn using of neovim. To access neovim, just type <b>nvim +Tutor</b>. This may looks exactly like vim tutor. But don't worry. You will see some difference at last. </p>
	    <p>One main important this you will see is neovim configuration file location. <p>
	    <ol>
		    <li> ~/.config/nvim/init.vim </li>
		    <li> ~/.config/nvim/init.lua </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p> Option 1 is provided in neovim tutor. This is the config file of neovim. But option 2 is great, since it is a Lua file. Lua configuration is what which makes neovim actually awesome. So, option 2 is more used in configuring neovim. </p>
	    <p>Later, in this series you will get informations about this lua configuration file. </p>
