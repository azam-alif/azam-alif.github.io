        <h2>What is the Maxwell–Boltzmann Distribution?</h2>

        <p>
          Imagine placing a bunch of particles inside a box and fixing the temperature.
          Even then, you will never find all particles moving with the same speed.
          Some are slow, some are extremely fast, but most of them hover around a
          typical value.
        </p>

        <p>
          This simple idea, when treated properly using classical statistical mechanics,
          leads to what we call the <b>Maxwell–Boltzmann (MB) velocity distribution</b>.
          It describes how particle speeds are distributed when the system is in
          thermal equilibrium. The key point is that the distribution depends only on
          the particle mass and the temperature.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a three-dimensional system, the probability density of finding a particle
          with speed \(v\) is
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
          f(v) = 4\pi \left( \frac{m}{2\pi k_B T} \right)^{3/2}
          v^2 \cdot \exp(-\frac{m v^2}{2 k_B T})
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          Here, \(m\) is the particle mass, \(T\) is the temperature, and
          \(k_B\) is the Boltzmann constant.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the Shape of the MB Curve</h2>

        <p>
          Below is the Maxwell–Boltzmann curve plotted using SI units with
          \(m = 6.63\times10^{-26}\,\text{kg}\),
          \(k_B = 1.38\times10^{-23}\,\text{J/K}\),
          and \(T = 300\,\text{K}\).
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="images/mb-graph.png"
               alt="Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution at 300 K">
        </div>

        <p>
          The curve is clearly asymmetric. The peak corresponds to the
          <b>most probable speed</b> — the speed that the largest number of particles have.
        </p>

        <p>
          To see where this shape comes from, ignore the constants and focus only on
          the structure of the equation:
        </p>

        <p>
          \[
          f(v) \propto v^2 e^{-v^2}
          \]
        </p>

        <p>
          At very low velocities, the \(v^2\) term dominates and suppresses small speeds.
          At very high velocities, the exponential term takes over and rapidly kills
          the probability. The competition between these two effects produces the
          characteristic MB curve.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">
          <img src="images/mb-comparison-graph.png"
               alt="Effect of v squared and exponential terms">
        </div>

        <p>
          So low velocities are suppressed by the \(v^2\) factor, while high velocities
          are suppressed exponentially due to thermal energy limits.
        </p>

        <h2>Effect of Temperature</h2>

        <p>
          Increasing the temperature shifts the peak of the distribution to the right
          and makes the curve broader. Higher temperature simply means higher average
          kinetic energy, so particles explore larger speeds.
        </p>

          <img src="images/mb-temp-change.png"
               alt="Temperature dependence of MB distribution">
        </div>

        <p>
          One important thing never changes: the area under each curve remains the same.
          Regardless of temperature, the total probability must always be 1.
        </p>

        <!-- LAMMPS section starts after this -->
        
	<h2>Getting Velocities from LAMMPS</h2>
        <p>
          In molecular dynamics, LAMMPS integrates Newton’s equations of motion and explicitly stores
          particle velocities. These velocities can be written to a dump file using:
        </p>

        <pre><code>
dump 1 all custom 100 vel.dump id type x y z vx vy vz
        </code></pre>

        <p>
          After the system reaches equilibrium (typically under an NVT ensemble),
          the velocities stored in the dump file should follow the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution.
        </p>

        <h2>Velocity Histogram from Simulation</h2>
        <p>
          From the dump file, the speed of each particle is computed as
          \[
          v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}
          \]
          A histogram of these speeds is then plotted and normalized to form a probability density.
        </p>

        <p>
          When overlaid with the theoretical MB curve (using the same temperature and mass),
          the histogram should match closely. Any deviation usually indicates insufficient
          equilibration or incorrect unit conversion.
        </p>

        <div class="image-container">

        </div>

        <h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p>
          The agreement between the LAMMPS velocity histogram and the Maxwell–Boltzmann curve
          confirms that the simulation is thermally equilibrated and that temperature control
          is working correctly. This is one of the simplest and most reliable sanity checks
          in molecular dynamics.
