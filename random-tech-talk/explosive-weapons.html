        <p> Explosive weapons have been used in warfare for hundreds of years. More than 25,000 people died in 2024 alone due to explosive weapons. Some popular weapons are: rockets, missiles, torpedoes etc. We seem to have mixed them up a bit here. Here I will demonstrate some brief characteristics of each type. </br></p>
        <p> <b>Rocket: </b> An unguided weapon, meaning no guidance system is available on it. Once launched in a direction, it follows a parabolic path toward the target. It is propelled by its own engine, which generates thrust to move forward. Without a guidance system, it is more vulnerable to the wind and air defense systems.  </p>
        <p> <b>Missile: </b> This can be considered a guided rocket, meaning it has a guidance system within it. It can adjust its path during flight to hit the target. It uses sensors like radar, GPS, laser and control systems to steer in real time. That's why it can be launched from several thousand kilometers away from the target. Missiles can be launched from land, air and sea. </p>
        <p> <b>Torpedo: </b>An underwater short-range missile. Its range is only tens of kilometers. It is launched from a marine vehicle and targets another marine vehicle. Due to  its underwater-moving nature, it is extremely devastating for the navy. 
        <p> <b>Artillery: </b>A short to medium range weapon, that uses unguided artillery shells as firepower. Cannons, tank guns, mortars are different types of artillery styles based on range and mobility. </p>
