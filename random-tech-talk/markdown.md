### Capacitor

## Halliday-Resnick

- Capacitors are devices that store energy in an electrostatic field.
- We can charge a capacitor by connecting its two plates to the opposite terminals of a battery. Since the plates (two conductors are called plates regardless of their shape) are conductors, they are equipotentials, and the potential difference of the battery appears across the plates. While charging, the battery transfers equal and opposite charges to the two plates.

**Why does each plate receive a charge of exactly the same magnitude?**  
When a capacitor is connected to a battery, electrons are transferred from one plate to the other through the external circuit. For every electron that leaves one plate, an electron arrives at the other plate. This ensures that the plates always have equal and opposite charges, maintaining charge conservation. Therefore, each plate receives a charge of exactly the same magnitude but opposite in sign.

**Is this true even if the plates are different sizes?**  
Yes, this is true even if the plates are of different sizes. The charge transferred is determined by the battery and the circuit, not by the plate size. However, the capacitance (the ability to store charge for a given voltage) does depend on the plate area and separation, but the charges on the plates remain equal in magnitude and opposite in sign.


**You are given two capacitors, C1 and C2,in which C1>C2. How could things be arranged so that C2 could hold more charge than C1?**

To make C₂ hold more charge than C₁ (where C₁ > C₂), connect them in series.
In a series combination, both capacitors hold the same charge regardless of their capacitance.
This contrasts with a parallel arrangement, where the capacitor with higher capacitance holds more charge.
Thus, in series, C₂ can hold as much charge as C₁, even though C₂ < C₁.


**If surface charge density $\sigma = \frac{1}{R}$, meaning charge tends to accumulate at sharp points and avoid flat surfaces on isolated conductors, then why do flat capacitor plates clearly hold surface charge?**

**Ans:** capacitor is not an isolated conductor. 

**With respect to what variables capacitance C remains constant?**

**In RC circuit the charge that the capacitor stores is uneffected by the resistance of the resistor.What purpose, then is served by the resistor?**
The resistor in an RC circuit controls the rate at which the capacitor charges or discharges. While the final amount of charge stored on the capacitor depends only on the applied voltage and the capacitance, the resistor determines how quickly the capacitor reaches that charge. It sets the time constant $\tau = RC $, which characterizes the exponential charging and discharging behavior. The resistor also limits the current, protecting the circuit components from sudden surges.
